Arduino exercises for classes at the University of Science and Technology
___
## Exercises
- 2.1  
  - Green button pressed => couter incrementation
  - Red button pressed => couter decrementation
  - Both buttons pressed => led blinking as many times as couter value
  - buttons vibration reduction
- 2.2  
    - Show button pressed time in format H:MM:SS.z
- 2.2_modification
	- Show buttons (RED and GREEN) pressed time.
	  If during holding one button, we start hold other button, then result will be sum of RED and GREEN button hold time
- 2.3   (Communication with led diode from terminal UART)
    - LED ON 
    - LED OFF 
    - LED BLINK <time_ms> – blink LED diode with given frequency
    - LED BLINK – blink LED diode with default frequency
