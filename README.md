Various arduino exercises for classes at the University of Science and Technology 

## Exercises
- ✔️ 2.1  
  - Green button pressed => couter incrementation
  - Red button pressed => couter decrementation
  - Both buttons pressed => led blinking as many times as couter value
  - buttons debouncing (software solution)
- ✔️ 2.2  
    - Show button pressed time in format H:MM:SS.z
- ✔️ 2.2_modification
	- Show buttons (RED and GREEN) pressed time.
	  If during holding one button, we start hold other button, then result will be sum of RED and GREEN button hold time
- ✔️ 2.3   (Communication with led diode from terminal UART)
    - LED ON 
    - LED OFF 
    - LED BLINK <time_ms> – blink LED diode with given frequency
    - LED BLINK – blink LED diode with default frequency
- ✔️ 3.1   (Display actual voltage and ADC value from potentiometer)
- ✔️ 3.2   (Display actual voltage and ADC value from potentiometer with graphs on plotter)
- ✔️ 3.3   
    - Display user's text from UART on LCD 
    - Microcontroller remember last 10 user's inputs
    - "Scrolling" text on LCD by using buttons
    - If text size is bigger then maximum characters quantity, then text is displayed on screen with moving animation
